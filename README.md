# Investigating UN Meeting Records

How to:

1. Obtain the metadata from United Nations digital library search (https://digitallibrary.un.org)
2. Use `rvest` to scrape the pdfs from the search results
3. Convert them to .txt files
4. Read them into R
5. Split each file up by speaker
6. Use regular expressions to extract the speakers' names and organisations
7. Use `quanteda` to create a dictionary of terms of interest to see which speakers/organisations are talking about a topic the most

I had to carry out the above for a project so I thought I'd share my code to save someone else the pain of having to figure this out from scratch.

Many thanks to Dr Pablo Barber√° and Dr Gokhan Ciflikli for their invaluable help and advice.

Feedback would be greatly appreciated
